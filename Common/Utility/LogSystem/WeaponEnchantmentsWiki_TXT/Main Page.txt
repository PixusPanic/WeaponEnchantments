=== Config ===
Many players will find Enchantments to be too powerful. For players who enjoy a high difficulty experience, it is recommended to change the Enchantment Strength Preset to Expert (50%) or Master (25%). (2nd page of the config)<blockquote>You have an extreme amount of control over the power level of this mod via the config.</blockquote>

=== When you start a game... ===

* Make an enchanting table right away!
** The first enchanting table is created with a workbench and 4 torches.
* Gear yourself up (fill in your armor and accessory slots so they start getting XP).
* When upgrading, offer your old armor and weapons for essence.
* Upgrade your new weapons and armor with the obtained essence.

=== New Player Tips and Tricks ===

* DONT SELL enchantable items! Offer them instead.
** The value from ore received is slightly higher than an item's sell value and you get Essence equivalent to the item's xp.
** Offering items returns all Enchantments/Power Booster applied to the consumed item.
* Carrying an Enchanting Table with you to convert unwanted items is a good way to save inventory space.(Especially if you set the config to 0% ore, 100% essence)
* Make a gem tree farm (especially for diamond/amber). They are used to craft high tier Enchantments.

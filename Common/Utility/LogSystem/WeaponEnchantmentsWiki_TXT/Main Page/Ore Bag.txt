The Ore Bag is a storage item similar to a piggy bank.  It is given to every player when starting the game.<br/>
By default, the ore bag automatically stores all items you pick up (that are allowed in the Ore Bag) such as ore, bars, gems, sand, and glass.<br/>
This bag is mainly for making inventory management with Weapon Enchantments easier, and is heavily integrated with Magic Storage so that you don't have to dump the ore bag into magic storage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To open the bag, right click it from your inventory.  This will display the Ore Bag UI.<br/>

The Loot All, Deposit All, Quick Stack and Sort buttons work the same or very similar to the vanilla chest/piggy bank buttons.<br/>
The Toggle Vacuum button toggles items automatically being sent to the Ore Bag instead of your inventory.  Purple means on.<br/>
The Ore Bag holds up to 100 items.<br/>
The bag has a search bar and scroll bar to help find your items.<br/>
The Ore Bag UI can be moved by dragging anywhere on the UI that isn't a button or item slot.<br/>
The location of the ore bag UI is saved so you don't have to constantly reposition it.<br/>

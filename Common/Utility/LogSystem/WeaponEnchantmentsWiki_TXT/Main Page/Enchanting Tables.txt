All of the essence you pick up are stored in the enchanting table interface. Right clicking the enchanting table while it's placed in the world opens the interface. You can also right click the enchanting table item in your inventory, but it won't count for crafting enchantments.<br/>
In an enchanting table you can [[Enchantments#Crafting and Upgrading Enchantments|create and upgrade]] enchantments via crafting, [[#Enchanting items|apply and remove]] enchantments, [[#Leveling items up|convert essence to item experience]], [[#Offer|offer]] items, [[#Siphon|siphon]] items, [[#Infusion|infuse]] items, [[#Enchantment Storage|store items]], and [[#Enchantment Loadouts|manage/apply enchantment loadouts]].<br/>
=== Leveling items up ===
Item experienced can be gained by [[#|using the item]] or consuming essence in the enchanting table interface.
* Level Up button [[File:LevelUpButton.png]] (The numbers above the level up button determine how many levels will be added per click of the level up button.  Will do nothing if you do not have enough essence for the selected number of levels.)
# Place your item in the Item slot
# Click the Level Up button
# Enough essence is used to level your item up once.
Essence can be favorited in the enchanting table interface to prevent it from being consumed by the level up button (ignored if you don't have enough total essence to level up without the favorited essence)<br/>
* XP buttons [[File:XPButtons.png]]
# Place your item in the Item slot
# Click the XP button below the essence you want to consume for experience
# One essence of that type is consumed, adding experience to your item<br/>
=== Enchanting items ===
[[File:EnchantingTableUI.png]]<br/>
To enchant an item, it must have enough Enchantment Capacity to handle the new enchantment's capacity cost.
# Place the item you wish to enchant into the item slot.  (You can shift left click from your inventory instead of using your mouse)
# Add (or remove) the enchantment(s) you wish using the enchantment slots.  (Can also be shift clicked from your inventory)
# Remove the item from the enchanting table (move with mouse or shift click.)  (There is no confirm button for enchantments)<br/>
The Utility Slot is for [[Utility Enchantments]]<br/>
[[File:MusketTooltip.png]]<br/>
=== Offer [[File:OfferButton.png]] ===
If you have an enchantable item you would like to throw away, instead, you can offer it.  
Offering items gives you ores and essence equal to the item's value (rounds up), so you end up with slightly higher coins if you offer then sell something.  
It gives half ore and half essence by default (configurable).  It also returns all experience as essence and returns all enchantments and an installed power booster.<br/>
1. Place the item you want to offer in the item slot.<br/>
2. press the offer button. (The offer UI will display.  If the Toggle Auto Trash Offered Items option is on, purple, the item you offer will be saved in the list of your offered items.  Any time you pick up an item marked as trash, it will automatically be offered.  You remove items from being marked for automatic offering with [[#Manage Offered Items|Manage Offered Items]] in the Enchantment Storage.)<br/>
[[File:OfferUI.png]]<br/>
3. Press confirm.<br/>
4. You receive the offer rewards items.
<br/>
=== Mass offer config option ===
"Offer all of the same item." under Client Config, Enchanting Table Options.
This option enables to methods of mass offering items.  (This will not offer any item that has experience/enchantments/power boosters/etc)
# When offering an item, all of the same item will be offered from your inventory.
# When offering an item, ALL items of ANY type from chests directly touching the enchanting table will be offered.  Be careful with your storage.<br/>
=== Siphon [[File:SiphonButton.png]] ===
Siphoning an item removes all modifications to that item.
Siphoning is different from Offering because Siphoning prevents the item from being destroyed.
However, as a cost for saving the item, 20% (configurable) of the experience is lost.  (This is reduced to 4x the value of the item as essence value if the number is lower to prevent spending massive amounts of essence to save a low value item.)
# Place the item into the item slot.
# Click siphon.
# Essence, Enchantments and Power Boosters will be deposited into the enchanting table interface, and the infused item will be returned to you.<br/>
=== Infusion [[File:InfusionButton.png]] ===
Allows you to consume a weapon to enhance the power of a lower tier weapon to about the same power as the consumed weapon or transfers the set bonus from a piece of armor to another.  Any experience/enchantments/power booster on a consumed item will be returned just like [[#Offer|offer]].<br/>
==== Weapon Infusion ====
Allows you to consume a more powerful weapon to upgrade the damage of a lower power weapon.  
Example, if you like Veilthorn more than your newer/stronger weapon, just infuse the new weapon into Veilthorn to upgrade it's damage instead of switching.  
The damage bonus is based on the difference in infusion powers of the two weapons.
Infusion Power - A weapon stat that is determined by looking at how the weapon is obtained such as crafting or enemy/chest drops.
I manually set the infusion power of every gathered crafting material, every boss/enemy that drops a weapon/crafting material, and manually set any remaining ones.The basis I use for determining the infusion power is when a weapon is available during progression.
For instance, all weapons that are either dropped by Skeletron will have the same infusion power, and all weapon from the dungeon will be slightly higher than those dropped by Skeletron.
This is not a perfect way to determine the power of a weapon.  If a weapon is relatively powerful compared to when you can get it, the weapon will be more powerful than others when infused.Currently, the highest Infusion Power possible for vanilla weapons is from Zenith (1105).  Modded weapons can be up to a max of 1350 infusion power.

Weapon infusion steps:
# Place the higher Infusion Power item into the enchanting table (this item will be destroyed)
# Click Infusion (If you change your mind, you can get the item back by pressing Cancel - Same button as Infusion)
# Place the lower Infusion Power item into the enchanting table Click Finalize (Same button as Infusion/Cancel)<br/>
==== Armor Infusion ====
Allows you to consume a piece of armor and replace the set bonus of an item with one from another.  
The piece of armor will act like the consumed one for the purposes of determining set bonuses. The piece of armor will also look like the consumed one while equipped.  
Armor infusion steps:
# Place the armor with the set bonus you want to transfer into the enchanting table (this item will be destroyed)
# Click Infusion (If you change your mind, you can get the item back by pressing Cancel - Same button as Infusion)
# Place the armor you want to keep into the enchanting table (It will have it's set bonus replaced with the previous item's) Click Finalize (Same button as Infusion/Cancel)<br/>
==== Enchantment Storage ====
The Enchantment Storage is similar to a piggy bank.<br/>
It can store most of the items from Weapon Enchantments.<br/>
There are a lot of mouse interactions between the Enchantment Storage and Enchanting Table.  Shift left clicking is the easiest way to transfer enchantments between the two.<br/>
[[File:EnchantmentStorageUI.png]]<br/>
The Loot All, Deposit All, Quick Stack and Sort buttons work the same or very similar to the vanilla chest/piggy bank buttons.<br/>
Toggle Vacuum - Toggles items automatically being sent to the Enchantment Storage instead of your inventory.  Purple means on.<br/>
Toggle Mark Trash - Replaces your cursor with a trash can, and disables normal mouse actions.  Left click any enchantment in the storage to mark it as trash.  Be very careful when marking enchantments as trash.  Whenever you pick up an enchantment that is marked as trash, it will be uncrafted into essence.<br/>
Uncraft All Trash - Uncrafts every enchantment marked as trash into essence, containments and gems.  This is the same as crafting them into essence manually.<br/>
Revert All To Basic - Crafts every enchantment in the storage into basic versions, returning essence, gems and higher tier containments.  (Keep in mind you have to have basic containments to do this.)Manage Trash - Shows you every enchantment, allowing you to mark or unmark enchantments as trash even if you don't have them.<br/>
Manage Offered Items - Shows you every item that can be offered regardless of you having one or not.  Items with a trash can background will be automatically offered when picked up.<br/>
[[File:EnchantmentStorageUIManageOfferedItems.png]]<br/>
Quick Craft - Allows you to quickly craft any enchantment that you have the ability to craft.  Unlike normal crafting, the item crafted is sent to the enchantment storage instead of being picked up by your mouse.  This is meant to help with changing a lot of enchantments all at once.  Keep in mind, you have to be near an appropriate level enchanting table to craft enchantments, so using the enchanting table from your inventory will not work.<br/>
[[File:EnchantmentStorageUIQuickCraft.png]]<br/>
Items with a gold background can be crafted.If you already have some of an item that you can craft, the stack number will show on the gold background item.  If you don't already have any, the stack will be 0.  It also shows the rest of the enchantments that you can't craft, but that you have in storage at the end of the list with normal blue backgrounds.<br/>
Favoriting Enchantments - You can favorite enchantments by pressing the favorite key (alt by default) and clicking on an enchantment.  Favorited enchantments are ignored when uncrafting trash or reverting all to basic.<br/>
==== Enchantment Loadouts ====
[[File:EnchantmentLoadoutUI.png]]<br/>
Enchantment loadouts don't store items.
They just save the type and tier of enchantment.  When creating an Enchantment Loadout, you can quickly fill the slots by shift left clicking enchantments from your storage to fill the next slot (The next slot to fill has a gold background when shift is held).  You can also hold an enchantment in your mouse and click it on a slot instead.  Clicking on a slot with no enchantment in your mouse will clear the slot.<br/>
Add - Adds a new loadout (Max of 15).<br/>
Add From Equipped Enchantments - Create a loadout by copying your equipped enchantments<br/>
Loadout # - Clicking the Loadout button selects that loadout so you can see or edit it.<br/>
All - All replaces all enchantments on your held item, armor and accessories with the enchantments from the loadout.  If any item isn't high enough level to support the enchantments for it's slot, the loadout will fail to load.<br/>
Held Item/Armor/Accessories - These buttons to the same thing as the All button, but only load the specific enchantments for the selected category.<br/><br/>
==== Efficiently Upgrading your enchantment loadout ====
* Load a blank loadout to return all enchantments to the storage.
* Favorite any enchantments you want to keep.
* Revert All to Basic.
* Quick Craft all desired enchantments.
* Update and load your original loadout.<br/>

All weapons, armor and accessories can now gain experience (XP). These are enchantable items.<br/>

Items have a level based on their XP.  Levels increase the enchantment capacity of the item by 1 per level.  
Levels also increases weapon critical strike chance by 1 per level.  Armor and accessories grant you damage reduction per level. (Both can be disabled and are affected by the Config Global Enchantment Strength multiplier.)<br/>

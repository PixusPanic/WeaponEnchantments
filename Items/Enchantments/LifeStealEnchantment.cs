            $"Life Steal from an enchantment is not exactly the same as vanilla lifesteal.  Vanilla lifesteal calculates the " +
			$"amount of healing you will receive and truncates any decimal.  Lifesteal from an enchantment stores the decimal and " +
			$"adds it to your heal amount the next time you use lifesteal.  (Note: This remainder is reset to zero if you reach " +
			$"full health)  This makes lifesteal from enchantments valuable on any weapon because you can heal some regardless of " +
			$"the damage per hit.  Lifesteal from enchantments utilizes the same lifesteal limiting as vanilla does.  This " +
			$"limit is very unlikely to be reached unless you are using a weapon at least as powerful as the Zenith.  At that point, " +
			$"you may reach the limit.  If you do exceed the limit, you will gain zero life from lifesteal util it has recovered.  " +
			$"The amount the limit value is affected can be adjusted in the config.  (Note: the config option does not affect any " +
			$"source of lifesteal besides lifesteal from enchantments.)  Life steal gained from minions is reduced by half. (I may " +
			$"ban it or reduce it more on minions at some point in the future.  Haven't decided yet.)  Vanilla lifesteal allows you " +
			$"heal from lifesteal when already at full health (wasting the life steal pool for no reason).  Enchantments do not do this.  " +
			$"Additionally, life steal from enchantments will not over heal you past full health which would also waste the pool.  " +
			$"The moon lord's Moon Leach debuff normally prevents all lifesteal.  I personally don't like mechanics that completely " +
			$"turn off effects like this, so life steal from enchantments is reduced by 50% from this debuff instead.";

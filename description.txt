Weapon Enchantments adds
     -Item customization
     -Progression system

Terraria has you frequently swapping old gear for new.
The enchanting system allows you to keep your progress as you upgrade gear.

Basics:
    Experience:
        -All weapons/armor/accessories gain experience when used to kill enemies. (Items have xp, not players)
        -Items have a level based on their xp. (Not visible if xp is 0)
    Enchantments:
        -Found in chests or dropped by enemies.
        -Added to items in an Enchanting Table.
        -Enchantments have a level cost
            Ex. A level 4 weapon can apply 2 Basic Damage Enchantments (cost 2 Enchantment Capacity each).
        -Require a larger Containment to upgrade an Enchantment.
    Essence:
        -Resource for upgrading Enchantments or consumed to add xp to items in an Enchanting Table.
    Enchanting Table:
        -Used to apply Enchantments to items.
        -Used to consume Essence to add xp to items.
        -Can PERMENANTLY consume items in exchange for Essence and ores(mix of iron/silver/gold).

First 5 minutes:
     -Make a Wood Enchanting Table. (workbench and 4 torches)
     -Fill your armor/accessory slots ASAP. (All equipped armor/accessories gains xp while equipped, so slap on your shackle and wood armor)

Tips:
    -DONT SELL weapons/armor/accessories. Offer them instead.  
        The value from ore and essence recieved is slightly higher than an item's sell value and you get Essence equivalent to the item's xp. 
        Offering items returns all Enchantments/Power Booster applied to the consumed item.
    -Carrying an Enchanting Table with you to convert unwanted items is a good way to save inventory space.
    -Make a gem tree farm (especially for diamond/amber).  They are used in crafting high tier Containments.

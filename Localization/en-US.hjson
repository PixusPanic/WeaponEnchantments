					Tooltip:
						'''
						Use a value above 100% to limit lifesteal more, less than 100% to limit less.  0 to have not limit.
						Vanilla Terraria uses a lifesteal limiting system: In the below example, the values used are in normal mode(Expert/Master mode values in parenthesis)
						It has a pool of 80(70) that is saved for you to gain lifesteal from.  Gaining life through lifesteal reduces this pool.
						The pool is restored by 36(30) points per second.  If the pool value is negative, you cannot gain life from lifesteal.
						This config value changes how much the life you heal from lifesteal enchantments affects this limit.
						Example: 200%  You gain 200 life from lifesteal.  200 * 200% = 400.  80(70) pool - 400 healed = -320(-330) pool.
						It will take 320/36(330/30) seconds -> 8.9(11) seconds for the pool to be positive again so you can gain life from lifesteal again.
						Note: the mechanic does not have a cap on how much you can gain at once.  It will just take longer to recover the more you gain.
